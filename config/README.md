# ⚙️ Configuration Files

System configuration and deployment files

## Key Files

• docker-compose.yml - Docker services configuration
• gunicorn.conf.py - Production server configuration
• stock-dashboard.service - Systemd service file

## Usage

Run scripts from the project root directory:
```bash
# Example
python config/script_name.py
```

## Note

These files have been organized for better project structure. 
All scripts should still be run from the main project directory.
